# Create React App on Azure Static Web Sites with Azure Developer CLI (azd)


Here's a quick sample to demo how we can quickly get a React app running on Azure with the Azure Developer CLI (azd).


## Prerequisites

1. Install Azure Developer CLI https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install
1. Install Node.js https://nodejs.org

## Run azd up

With the Azure Developer CLI's up command, you can get the entire application up and running on Azure with a single command:

```
azd up -t jongio/azd-create-react-app-swa
```

You can also clone locally, open in DevContainer, or Codespaces and just run:

```
azd up
```
